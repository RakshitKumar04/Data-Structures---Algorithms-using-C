# DATA STRUCTURE & ALGORITHMS
Will be implementing the basic algorithms using c language.
<br>
# ARRAY
- #### Deletion at the beginning
- #### Deletion at the end
- #### Deletion at the entered index
- #### Insertion at the beginning
- #### Insertion at the end
- #### Insertion at the entered index
- #### Merged Deletion
    In this we build a menu driven program to delete at the beginning, end and the entered index number.
- #### Merged Insertion
    In this we build a menu driven program to insert at the beginning, end and the entered index number.
# DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
- #### calloc
- #### free
- #### malloc
# LINKED LISTS
- #### Traversing a Linked List
    In this we will create and read a linked list.
- #### Register
    In this we are taking and displaying the data of a class.
## #SINGLE LINKED LIST
### +INSERTION
- #### Inserting a node at begining
    In this we will insert a node at the begining of a already created linked list.
- #### Inserting a node at end
    In this we will insert a node at the end of a already created linked list.
- #### Inserting a node after a given node
    In this we will insert a node after a given node of a already created linked list.
- #### Inserting a node before a given node
    In this we will insert a node before a given node of a already created linked list.
### -DELETION
- #### Deleting a node at beginning
    In this we will delete a node at the begining of a already created linked list.
- #### Deleting a node at end
    In this we will delete a node at the end of a already created linked list.
- #### Deletion a node at the given node
    In this we will delete a node at the given location of a already created linked list.
# STRING
- #### Appending
    In this we will concatenate two string.
- #### Comparing <br> 
    In this we are comparing to strings.
- #### Inserting
    In this we will be inserting a substring in a main sentence.
- #### Reversing
    In this we are reversing a string.
- #### Size
    In this we are finding the size of a string.
- #### Substring
    In this we will extract the substring from a string.   
- #### Upper & Lower
    In this we are converting lower string to upper and vice versa.
- #### Mixed Function
    In this we build a menu driven program, that runs all the above function.
